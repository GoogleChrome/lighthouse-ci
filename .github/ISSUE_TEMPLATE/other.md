<!--
Here are some general guidelines for what's appropriate for a GitHub issue compared to another forum :)

Generally, file an issue and expect a response from a maintainer when...

- You've found a bug with clear reproduction steps.
- Document is incorrect or completely missing.
- You have an idea for new functionality you'd like to share for discussion.
- You've thoroughly searched previous issues for related problems and haven't found anything.

Generally, avoid filing an issue and/or don't expect a response from a maintainer when...

- You're wondering how stuff works.
- You'd like help fitting the project into your specific workflow.
- Any other questions that wouldn't require changes to the project or be uniquely answered by project maintainers.

This second set of questions is better handled by community discussions (which maintainers also participate in 😃) and places like IRC/Discord/Gitter/chat rooms, GitHub discussions (when available), or other forums like Stack Overflow. 

Thank you for respecting the time of everyone involved in keeping this project going!
