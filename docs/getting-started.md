# Getting Started

## Overview

Estimated Time: ~15 minutes

This document provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to setup Lighthouse CI on your repository. After this guide, your build system will be running Lighthouse on your project's URLs on every commit, automatically asserting that important Lighthouse audits pass, and uploading the reports for manual inspection.

**Important Note Before Starting**

Introducing performance measurement to a project for the first time can have a fairly steep learning curve. To avoid biting off more than you can chew at first, Lighthouse team recommends starting slowly. Refer to the [recommended configurations documentation](./configuration.md#recommendations) for advice on where to start based on your experience level and the project's maturity if you run into any issues.

## Prerequisites

Your project should meet the following requirements:

1. Source code is managed with git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc).
2. Branches/pull requests are gated on the results of a continuous integration build process (Travis CI, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, AppVeyor, GitHub Actions, etc). If you aren't using a build process yet, [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.org) offers free continuous integration for open-source projects.
3. Your CI process can build your project into production assets (typically provided as an `npm run build` command by most JavaScript frameworks).
4. Your project either:
   A) has a command that runs a web server with production-like assets.
   B) is a static site.

In the examples that follow, use of GitHub and Travis CI are assumed but the same concepts apply to other providers. Refer to your specific provider's documentation for how to accomplish each setup step.

## Collect Lighthouse Results

The below travis config will automatically find your project's static assets, run Lighthouse 3 times on each HTML file, and upload the reports to _temporary public_ storage where they'll be accessible to anyone with the URL.

NOTE: As the name implies, this is _temporary_ and _public_ storage. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of your Lighthouse reports being stored on a public URL on Google Cloud, skip to the [add assertions](#add-assertions) or [Lighthouse CI server](#the-lighthouse-ci-server) steps. Reports are automatically deleted 7 days after upload.

**.travis.yml**

```yaml
# dist: xenial (the default) or newer required
language: node_js # Node 10 LTS or later required
addons:
  chrome: stable # make Chrome available
before_install:
  - npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.3.x # install LHCI
script:
  - npm run build # build your site
  - npm test # run your normal tests
after_success:
  - lhci autorun --upload.target=temporary-public-storage # run lighthouse CI against your static site
```


<details>
<summary>Github Actions</summary>
<br />
   
```yaml
name: Build project + run Lighthouse CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: npm install, build
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
      run: |
          npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.3.x
          lhci autorun --config=./lighthouse/lighthouserc.json
      env:
        LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}

```
</details>

That's it! With this in place, you'll have Lighthouse reports collected and uploaded with links to each report.

If your site isn't static or requires a custom webserver of some sort, refer to the [autorun docs](./cli.md#autorun) for more on how to configure LHCI to integrate with your server.

Read on to find out how to [add assertions](#add-assertions), configure the [Lighthouse CI server](#the-lighthouse-ci-server) for report diffs and timeseries charts, and enable [GitHub status checks](#github-status-checks).

## Add Assertions

**NOTE:** If you're new to performance measurement or your site has a lot of room for improvement, we recommend skipping this step for now and revisiting once your Lighthouse scores are a little higher.

While Lighthouse reports at your fingertips is great, failing the build based on the audit results is even better! Add an assertion preset option to get started with assertions.

```yaml
script:
  - npm run build # build your site
  - npm test # run your normal tests
  - lhci autorun --assert.preset=lighthouse:recommended # run Lighthouse CI on your static site and assert the recommended preset
```

**NOTE:** the `lhci autorun` command moved from `after_success` to `script` in this example because we'd like the exit code of `lhci` to fail the build.

The setup so far will automatically assert the Lighthouse team's recommended set of audits, but your project might have a bit of work to go before hitting straight 100s! Fear not, the assertions are completely configurable and you can disable as many audits as you need. Read more about what's possible in [configuration](./configuration.md) with [the assertions format](./assertions.md).

## Configuration

Lighthouse CI uses a `lighthouserc.json` file to configure all the core commands used. You can replace the options on the command-line we've seen so far with the following configuration file. Read more about how to configure Lighthouse CI [in our docs](./configuration.md).

```bash
# no need to pass explicit options
# lighthouserc.json will be automatically picked up if it's in the cwd
lhci autorun
```

**lighthouserc.json**

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "numberOfRuns": 3
    },
    "assert": {
      "preset": "lighthouse:recommended",
      "assertions": {
        "offscreen-images": "off",
        "uses-webp-images": "off"
      }
    },
    "upload": {
      "target": "temporary-public-storage"
    }
  }
}
```

## GitHub Status Checks

The setup so far will fail builds through your CI provider, but there's no differentiation between the build failing because of Lighthouse CI versus your other tests. Links to the Lighthouse report are also tucked away in your build logs.

GitHub status checks add additional granularity to your build reporting and direct links to uploaded reports within the GitHub UI!

![screenshot of GitHub status checks for Lighthouse CI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2301202/68001177-0b9dd180-fc31-11e9-8091-ada8c6e50a9b.png)

#### GitHub App Method (Recommended)

To enable GitHub status checks via the official GitHub app, [install and authorize the app](https://github.com/apps/lighthouse-ci) with the owner of the target repo. If the repo is within an organization, organization approval might be necessary. Copy the token provided on the authorization confirmation page and [add it to your build environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) as `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`. The next time your `lhci upload` command runs it will also set the results as GitHub status checks!

Be sure to keep this token secret. Anyone in possession of this token will be able to set status checks on your repository.

#### Alternative: Personal Access Token Method

If you don't want to use the Github App, you can enable this via a personal access token. The only difference is that your user account (and its avatar) will post a status check. [Create a token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo:status` scope and [add it to your environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) as `LHCI_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Be sure to keep this token secret. Anyone in possession of this token will be able to set status checks on your repository.

> Diffing between runs isn't available from `temporary-public-storage`, you have to run a LHCI server and setup your build to upload files there in order to get it. See [Lighthouse CI Server docs](#the-lighthouse-ci-server) for details.

### The Lighthouse CI Server

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39191/68522781-496bad00-0264-11ea-800a-ed86dbb04366.png" width="48%"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39191/68522269-7917b680-025e-11ea-8d96-2774c0a0b04c.png" width="48%">

Historical reports and advanced report diffing is available with the Lighthouse CI server. For setup of the server itself, see [our server recipe](./recipes/docker-server/README.md).

Once the server is set up, create a a new project with the lhci wizard:

```bash
$ lhci wizard
? Which wizard do you want to run? new-project
? What is the URL of your LHCI server? https://your-lhci-server.example.com/
? What would you like to name the project? My Favorite Project
? Where is the project's code hosted? https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci

Created project My Favorite Project (XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX)!
Use token XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX to connect.
```

Add your token to your CI with the environment variable `LHCI_TOKEN`. Alternatively, you can pass it to `upload` with the `--token` flag:

```
lhci upload --serverBaseUrl="https://your-lhci-server-url.com" --token="$LHCI_SERVER_TOKEN"
```

Note that this token is only semi-secret. Anyone with HTTP access to the server will already be able to view and create data on the server as it is unauthenticated.
