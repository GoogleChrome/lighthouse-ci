# Lighthouse CI

## Overview

Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools that make continuously running, saving, retrieving, and asserting against [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) results as easy as possible.

### Quick Start

To get started with GitHub actions for common project configurations, add the following file to your GitHub repository. Follow [the Getting Started guide](./docs/getting-started.md) for a more complete walkthrough and instructions on other providers and setups.

**.github/workflows/ci.yml**

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  lighthouseci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      - run: npm install && npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.6.x
      - run: npm run build
      - run: lhci autorun
```

### Features

- Get a Lighthouse report alongside every PR.
- Prevent regressions in accessibility, SEO, offline support, and performance best practices.
- Track performance metrics and Lighthouse scores over time.
- Set and keep performance budgets on scripts and images.
- Run Lighthouse many times to reduce variance.
- Compare two versions of your site to find improvements and regressions of individual resources.
