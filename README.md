# Lighthouse CI

## Overview

Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools that make continuously running, asserting, saving, and retrieving [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) results as easy as possible.

The node CLI (`npm install -g @lhci/cli`) runs Lighthouse, asserts results, and uploads reports.

The node server (`npm install @lhci/server`) stores results, compares reports, and displays historical results with a dashboard UI.

### Use Cases

- Get a Lighthouse report alongside every PR.
- Prevent regressions in accessibility, SEO, offline support, and performance best practices.
- Track performance metrics and Lighthouse scores over time.
- Set and keep performance budgets on scripts and images.
- Run Lighthouse many times to reduce variance.
- Compare two versions of your site to find improvements and regressions of individual resources.
